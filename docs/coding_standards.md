# 📓 My Coding Notes & Guidelines

This is my personal reference for how I like to organize my projects.

## 🎯 My Basic Principles

1. **Code should be readable** - I should understand it later
2. **Document what's important** - Especially why I made choices
3. **Keep learning** - Try new approaches in different projects

## 📁 How I Organize Projects

Each project can have its own style, but I generally include:
- A `notebooks/` folder for exploration
- A `src/` or `code/` folder for final code
- A `data/` folder (with raw/processed subfolders)
- A `README.md` explaining what the project does

## 🐍 Python Preferences

- I use **meaningful names** for variables and functions
- I add **comments** when I do something clever or complex
- I **experiment freely** but keep the final code clean

## 🔧 My Minimum Requirements

- The project should **run without errors**
- I should remember **how to use it** later
- I should know **what it accomplishes**

## 📚 Learning & Experimentation

- I try **new libraries** in different projects
- I document **what worked and what didn't**
- I **copy good ideas** from previous projects
