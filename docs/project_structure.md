# 📁 **Project Structure Guide (Flexible)**

This document explains the flexible structure of our projects and how to navigate them.

## 🎯 **Purpose**
To provide a consistent but adaptable framework for different types of projects while maintaining organization and clarity.

## 📊 **Basic Structure Overview**
```
project_name/
├── 📁 data/                 # Data storage (raw & processed)
├── 📁 notebooks/           # Exploration & experimentation
├── 📁 src/                 # Source code (can be named differently)
├── 📁 models/              # Trained models (if applicable)
├── 📁 docs/                # Project documentation
├── 📄 requirements.txt     # Dependencies
└── 📄 README.md           # Project overview
```

## 🔄 **Flexible Elements**

### You Can Customize:
- **Folder names** (src/ → code/ → lib/)
- **Organization style** (module-based vs functional)
- **Technology choices** (different libraries per project)
- **Documentation depth** (from minimal to extensive)

### Should Maintain:
- **Clear separation** of concerns
- **Basic documentation** in README
- **Dependency management**
- **Data organization** (raw/processed separation)

## 🚀 **Project Variations**

### Machine Learning Project
```

│   └── model_training.py
└── 📁 models/             # Saved models
```

### Web Project
```
web_project/
├── 📁 frontend/
│   ├── 📁 src/
│   └── 📁 public/
├── 📁 backend/

```

## 📝 **Minimum Requirements**
- A `README.md` explaining what the project does
- Clear separation between code and data
- Basic instructions for setup and running
- Documentation of key design decisions

## 💡 **Adaptation Guide**
1. **Choose structure** that fits your project type
2. **Document deviations** from standard patterns
3. **Keep consistent** within each project
4. **Learn and improve** from previous projects

## 🔧 **Quick Start**
1. Copy the basic structure
2. Adapt to your project needs
3. Document your choices
4. Start coding!
